Wordpress,when it says, the beautiful theme is just flashed. The theme is first gate to make the site as beautiful and attractive.
So far, Divi, Avada, Envato, X, Storefront, Zeimen (client specific) ..., experienced in various theme .
As the theme has embeded composer, it is easy to make page. By  my think, the divi's library feature is very good.
And speed is also good. I always care performance when building site.
